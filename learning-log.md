# Learning Log

## Jan 2, 2018
Day 2 of learning and playing with git.
Today's focus was on the basics of adding/removing files and folders, committing the changes and pushing them to the remote repository on github.  
- deleted the local repositoring and re-cloned github project
- added learning log of practice time (this file)
- practiced adding new/changed files (git add)
